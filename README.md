# String Calculator TDD Kata

This repository contains my solution to the **Incubyte TDD Assessment** (String Calculator Kata) implemented in **Ruby** using **RSpec**.

The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices by evolving the code step by step, with frequent commits showing the TDD cycle:  
**Red → Green → Refactor**.
